<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a recent Master's graduate from the joint program between Hefei University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was advised by Professors from both institutions. I obtained my B.S. in Computer Technology and Science from Hefei University, with a focus on Machine Learning. My expertise lies in Multimodal Large Models, Image Generation, and Object Detection. I have practical experience in applying AI to industrial scenarios such as defect identification in power systems and pest detection in agriculture. I am currently seeking R&D or engineering positions focused on the fine-tuning, deployment, and application of Multimodal and T2I models.
